# Wordloom

A text exploration tool that tries to provide word contextualisation within a larger text. It allows readers to see every mention of a word in context as they progress through the text.

**This is a work in progress**.

## Technology

This project is built using **SvelteKit**.


## How It Works

Wordloom presents a document's text as a continuous line that users can read or scroll through. When a word is highlighted (either by user selection or automatic progression), the tool displays additional lines before and after the current line that also contain the highlighted word. These contextual lines are aligned for easy reading and comparison.

Wordloom is an experimental project. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
